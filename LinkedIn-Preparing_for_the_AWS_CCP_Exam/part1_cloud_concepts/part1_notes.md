### [What is the Cloud?](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-aws-for-non-engineers-1-cloud-concepts-2/what-is-the-cloud?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3Aember8982)

It is just the internet (Global Network of Connected Devices). 

- Worldwide network

- Many devices

- Communication

How it works:

- You open your browser,

- Your browser sends a request to your ISP (Internet Service Provider)

- Your ISP sends a request to a server that searches for the domain name you requested (web host)

- If it finds a match, it will route your request to the IP address of the server hosting the website

- Then the server responds by sending the webpage in little "packets" back to your computer

### [What is Cloud Computing?](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-aws-for-non-engineers-1-cloud-concepts-2/what-is-cloud-computing?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3Aember8982)

It allows you to access your data from anywhere that you have an internet connection.

- In the 1950's Mainframe Computing was invented

    - Mainframe Computing: The concept of a central computer accessed by numerous user devices. The central computer (Mainframe) had all the computing capabilities, and the devices that would send request to the mainframe were called "dumb terminals"
    
- In the 1970's the concept of Virtual Machines emerged

    - Virtual Machines: Multiple complete operating systems that "live" in a single piece of hardware
    
    - Example: You can have multiple Windows virtual machines running on your single Mac laptop
    
- Then there was Hypervisor (this was the start of cloud computing)

    - Software that links multiple hardware to use as one giant resource

### [Cloud Computing Models](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-aws-for-non-engineers-1-cloud-concepts-2/cloud-computing-models?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3Aember8982)

There are 3 main Cloud Computing models:

1. Software as a service (SaaS - Consume)

    - "Completed products" managed by the service provider
    
    - Easy and ready to use as the end user
    
    - Less flexibility, but you only have to worry about how you would use the service to fulfill your need

2. Platform as a service (PaaS - Build)

    - Allows you to deploy and manage applications without having to worry about the underline hardware infrastructure
    
    - Services offered could be web servers, databases, operating systems, or environments where you can execute specific programing languages to host applications
    
    - Less flexibility than IaaS, as packages are pre-constructed, but you deal with less of the infrastructure deployment and maintenance, which allows you more time and resources to focus on the project on hand

3. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS - Host)

    - The basic building blocks of cloud IT infrastructure
    
    - You have control over the networking, security, computer, and servers
    
    - Provides the most flexibility and management control of all the different types of cloud computing models
    
    - Closest in features to having traditional on-premises data center
    
### [Cloud Computing Deployment Models](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-aws-for-non-engineers-1-cloud-concepts-2/cloud-computing-deployments?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3Aember8982)

- Cloud Deployment

    - 100% of IT infrastructure reside and run on the cloud
    
    - All applications migrated to or created in the cloud
    
    - The organization relies on their internet, and the cloud computing service provider to fulfill their computational and IT requirements
    
    - Allows for flexibility and scalability of resources
    
    - Removes the roadblock of the costly and time-consuming procurement and management processes

- On-Premises / Private Cloud Deployment

    - Organizations use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers
    
    - Often looks like the traditional IT infrastructure
    
    - Does not provide a lot of the benefits of cloud computing
        
    - Resources can not be accessed using the internet because they are fully on-site
    
    - Being the resources are not on the internet, this means that everything can be accessed quickly because nothing has to be uploaded or downloaded from the internet
    
    - Security: Provides dedicated resources that are not shared with any other organization

- Hybrid Deployment

    - Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources
    
    - Great for established companies that are in the process of migrating over the cloud
    
    - Data partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises data center
    
    - Can use as backup and disaster recovery solution
    
### [Design Principals of Cloud Computing](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-aws-for-non-engineers-1-cloud-concepts-2/design-principles-of-cloud-computing?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3Aember8982)

Knowing how to create a well-architected framework:

- Allows organizations to build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible

Best Practices:
    
1. Avoid unnecessary costs:
   
    - Use only what you need and turn off any servers or resources you aren't using

    - Reserve resources in advance if you know you'll need a certain amount of computing power, many services give discounts for reservations and up-front payment

    - Continue to monitor for more ways to optimize as your organizational needs change

    - Know which resources are causing which charges on your bills

2. Reliability:

    - Has the ability to recover from service disruptions often by itself

    - Can dynamically adjust resources to meet demand

    - Test disaster recovery settings

    - Incorporate redundancies (have duplicate copies of resources, so if one goes down the other can take over immediately) in your infrastructure

3. Efficiency:

    - The ability to use computing resources to adjust to system requirements
    
    - Should allow for more experimentation and when a change is set in motion it should be able to go global in minutes
    
4. Infrastructure Security:

    - Includes security of information, systems, and assets
    
    - Should be automated
    
    - Data should always be protected in transit and at rest
    
    - Traceability and a strong identity foundation should be enabled
    
    - In case of a security breach you should be able to see who did what at any point by using managed access
    
5. Operational Excellence:

    - Your ability to run and monitor systems while constantly improving processes and procedures
    
    - Everything should be documented
    
    - Operational procedures should be frequently refined
    
    - Failures should be anticipated and learned from
    
    - Systems and processes should be updated to take the failures into account
