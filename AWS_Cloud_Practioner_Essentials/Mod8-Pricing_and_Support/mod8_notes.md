The [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. 

Three types of offers are available: 

- Always Free
  - These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers
  - Examples:
    - AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month
    - Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month
- 12 Months Free
  - These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS
  - Examples:
    - Specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage
      - Standard is free for 12 months for up to 5 GB of storage
    - Thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time
    - Amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out
- Trials
  - Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service
  - The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service
  - Examples:
    - Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial
    - Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers where you can deploy ready-made application stacks) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period
