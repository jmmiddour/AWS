### Introduction
In this module, you will learn how to:

- Understand migration and innovation in the AWS Cloud.
- Summarize the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF).

## [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws_cloud_adoption_framework.pdf)

- Migrating to the cloud is a process
- What position you hold in your organization will impact the things that you need to know or help with for your migration
- You want to also ensure that you have the right talent to help support your migration
- The **Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)** exists to help provide advice to your company to enable a quick and smooth migration to AWS
- The framework organizes guidance into six areas focused on the different types of people that you'll need to involve for your migration
- Each perspective covers distinct responsibilities covered by different groups
- Each perspective is used to uncover gaps in your skills and processes, which are then recorded as ***inputs***
- These ***inputs*** are then used as the basis for creating what is called an ***AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Action Plan***
  - **AWS CAF Action Plan:** Helps guide your organization for cloud migration
- Having an action plan that makes sense for your organization can help keep you on track

   - Common roles in the Operations Perspective include:
     - IT Operations Managers
     - IT Support Managers

### Knowledge Check

Which Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework helps you design, implement, and optimize your AWS infrastructure based on your business goals and perspectives?

- [ ] Business Perspective

- [ ] Operations Perspective

- [ ] People Perspective

> The correct response option is **Platform Perspective**.
> 
> The Platform Perspective of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework also includes principles for implementing new solutions and migrating on-premises workloads to the cloud.
> 
> The other response options are incorrect because:
> 
> - The Business Perspective helps you to move from a model that separates business and IT strategies into a business model that integrates IT strategy.
> - The Operations Perspective focuses on operating and recovering IT workloads to meet the requirements of your business stakeholders.
